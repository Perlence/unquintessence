Low Level
=========

All these vain evenings I tried so hard to prevent.
We all were there,  
Waiting in the end of line to have a tiny chance.
We made fun of it.

The air was thick,
And indignity choked 
Me even harder.
Are we unworthy? Too much is 
Not enough.

A new doomed to fall through. But he will furthermore
Spin out our time
As we sit next to him frustrating.
They cheat... And I will.

Why didn't I 
Draw all these crazy 
Figures and lists.
Are we unworthy? Too much is 
Not enough.

Sorry, I won't be 
Home on holidays.
I have to redeem 
All that I've skipped.

Well, I have a plan to 
Rule things out. Don't you 
Worry. I'll take 
Everything step by step.

Why do you celebrate?
Do you understand the value of the moment?
I'll beat the crap out of you!
I'll beat the crap out of you!!!

Am I that unworthy?
I can't find no excuse.
When did it all start?
I didn't plan to end like this.

Am I that unworthy?
I can't find no excuse.
It's about to start over.
I won't face it unprepared.
