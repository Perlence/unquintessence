All these vain evenings I tried so hard to prevent.
We all were there, waiting and waiting to have an insignificant chance.
Oh, it wasn't funny as we thought it is. 

The air was thick and indignity choked me even harder.
Are we unworthy? Too much is not enough.

A new condemned to not succeed.
Yes, he will fail, but he'll spin out our time as we FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU sitting next to him.
They cheat, they cheat... And I will.

Why didn't I draw these crazy figures and undecipherable codes.
Are we unworthy? Too much is not enough.

Sorry, I won't be home on holidays.
I have to redeem all I failed.
(this was so generous)
Well, I have a plan to rule everything out. Don't you worry.

I was within hairbreadth of being unclassified.
Philosophy is for wusses.
Anyway who cares about electromagnetics.
It all was nearly failed.

Am I that unworthy?
I can't find no excuse.
When did it all started?
I didn't plan to end like this.

Am I that unworthy?
I can't find no excuse.
It's about to start over.
I won't face it unprepared.
