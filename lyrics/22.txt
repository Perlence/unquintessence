The Greatest Time
=================

Label every 
Instance of time.
Invest in your
Vale of years.
Do as much as
You're able to do.
Be in first line.
Shine like sun.

Smile wells up:
I dream of past
As of the greatest time.
Irrevocable seconds.
I wonder what would happen next.

Only sun
Is not enough
To guide me 
Throughout life.

I've tried to free my shoulders from the weight 
Of being the only one who bears all responsibility.
Somehow I failed at it before.
I guess it was only to the good.

Now I am back there.
There's no alternatives.
Hold on.
Cope with blame
Once again.

I pray for I won't deny my implication.
