Of The Greatest Time

[B]
Label every 
Instance of time.
Invest in your
Vale of years.
Do as much as
You're able to do.
Be in first line.
Shine like sun.

[C]
Smile wells up:
I dream of past
As of the greatest time.
Irrevocable seconds.
I wonder what would happen next.

[A:34]
Only sun
Is not enough
To guide me 
Throughout life.

[E]
I've tried to free my shoulders from the weight 
Of being the only one who bears all responsibility.
Somehow i failed at it before.
I guess it was only to the good.

[G']
Now i am back there.
There's no alternatives.
Hold on.
Cope with blame
Once again.

[H]		
I pray for i won't deny my implication.
