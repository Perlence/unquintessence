Glasshouse
==========

Feels like something more then us has died.
Feels like we were part of something great
And complex and now it's
No more with us.

We will never truly understand
How lucky we were when we entered
This confinement
Behind glass walls.

Time was divided in two halves.
Days of each were like one day
Duplicated
In cruel way.

When we're done with our 
Daily deeds we are 
Left to 
Our own devices.

Think of meaningless
And enter
Brand new day.
The day...

...When the rain poured down we 
Parted ways to the 
Shining sun and sparkling 
Freedom.

We were all as one in 
Our longing. Our 
Hope was channelled to this 
Very day.
