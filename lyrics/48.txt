Feels like something more then us has died.
Feels like we were part of something great
And complex and now it's
No more with us.

We will never truly understand
How lucky we were when we entered
This confinement
Behind glass walls.

Time was divided in two half
Days of each were like one day
Duplicated
In cruel way.

...

When the rain poured down
We parted ways
To the shining sun 
And sparkling freedom.

We were all as one
In our longing.
Our hope was channelled
To this very day.
