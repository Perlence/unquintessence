Council
=======

I feel like a spy or intruder
On these soldier guarded grounds.
It is quiet and looks deserted,
Everybody seems interested.

"Hello, young man, what's the problem.
You know someone regarded.
From this point I will guide you through
Military medication".

"Though it will
Cost you hundreds".

I remove steel from my pockets
Then I go to fill their stashes.

She is tall and she must see more
Beside abnormal curvature.
She suggests to look for answers
In the very lake of my soul.

I play fool because she is funny.
She points at the things I shouldn't.
Now I'm ready for the next move:
To fill stashes even fuller.

"Dr. Sexual Intension,
Tell me, what is wrong with me?
There's somewhere unobserved
Something feeds anxiety".

She insists on exploration,
But I am going to have to hurry.
I'm overreacting and
Run to further fill their stashes.

You break me down
With all this questioning.
Was she older?
Yes, but it didn't matter.

Story is to be told,
No one will get a thing:

"When spring comes
It's always strange and unreal.
It doesn't correlate with past."

I don't feel right.
I go home and strain my voice.
Screaming and shouting,
Banging my head like a maniac.

Time will come
And I'll forget details of
How this day 
Turned my soul inside out.
