I feel like a spy or intruder.
Awkward, I am not a relative.
It is quiet and looks deserted.
Everybody seems interested.

"Hello, stranger, what's the problem.
You know someone well regarded.
From this point I will guide you through
Military medication".

"Though it will
Cost you hundreds".

I remove steel from my pockets
Then expose myself by walking.

She is tall and she must see more
Beside abnormal curvature.
She suggest to search for causes
In the very lake of my soul.

I play fool because she is funny.
She points at the things I shouldn't.
Now I'm ready for the next move:
To expose myself by walking.

"Dr. Sexual Intension,
Tell me, what is wrong with me?
There's somewhere unobserved
Something feeds anxiety".

"Don't you wonder why I'm worried
In my age. There are plenty".
I'm overreacting and
I expose myself by running.

You break me down
With all this questioning.
Were she older?
Yes, but it didn't matter.

When spring comes
It's always strange and unreal.
It doesn't correlate with past.

I don't feel right.
I go home and strain my voice.
Screaming and shouting,
Banging my head like a maniac.

Time will come
And I'll forget details of
How this day 
Turned my soul inside out.
