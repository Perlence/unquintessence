Spiral of reminiscence
Will unroll to you.
Everlasting movement,
Unstoppable run.

Words of miserere.
Meet confused look.
Tide of guilt is coming.
I don't feel right.

I've tried to break the circle
Cutting off the links.
While I've sweared I'll always
Keep up them tight.

Seems it didn't work out.
I could not withstand.
The reminder of birth is
Breaking me down.

The lane loops through the picture of me
Using hunter skills to jump upon your desk,
Blaming you for the lack of understanding.
Half an hour versus lonely word.

Time will not cure wounds leaving no scars
Without my intrusion.
You will leave behind our promise
Without my intrusion.

Bloody interference
  Creeps me if they would.
I've told myself I will
  Do it on my own.
Time slips through wavering
  Raising price of step.
I keep uncertainty.
  So much we can lose.

Reroute! Reroute the watercourse!
We were always right: he is wasting time.
Reroute! Reroute the river flow!
And don't be afraid of making new mistakes.
