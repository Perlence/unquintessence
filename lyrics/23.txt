Lone Engineer
=============

I manage explosions
Guide fire through tunnels.
The power I posses
Is beyond my competence.

I never asked for this 
Augmentation of 
My inborn ability 
To traverse through space.

Impervious in their metal boxes
They think they only ones who right.

You take on yourself all
Responsibility.
You are my protection from
Their raging wheels.

Impervious in their metal boxes
They think they only ones who right.

Their eyes follow me with despise
Their watchful eyes. 
You better keep a distance for 
I am out of my control.

I disregard what is going 
Behind me. I move forward.
I can grasp ambiguity but 
I have hard time directing my parts in the right way.

Convenience I strive for might 
Change me in the long run. It is
Avoidable, but I was inflicted 
By benevolent intentions.

I change
Mind overly easily.
I temporize
To be just like them.

Three steps
On path to divinity
Will be 
My daily neurosis.

Impervious in their metal boxes
They think they only ones who right.
