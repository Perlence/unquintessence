If we fail to meet then
All of this, all my
Advances, achievements
Will all be for nothing.

Oh, it was a long run.
Exhausting.
Tokens of my fondness
In waveforms.

I'm about to break out.
Impatient.
Lights are out and I can feel:
It's near.

Day has come. I've done all
I could, all I can remember
I've laid on the
Tiny piece of paper.

And suddenly everything goes wrong
Thunder-striking news above my comprehension
The gaping chasm opens wide
The second chance will divide us forever.

If we fail to meet then
All of this,
All of my advances
Were in vein.

So I choose not to 
Challenge myself any more.
I give up. And my 
Acts will be appreciated later.

I sacrifice my wealth and well being to be there.

There is no way back.
I hit the road to home
Right now.

I am so excited 
I plant the seeds of further
Failure.

And suddenly everything goes wrong again.
A burst of memory through my desperate mind.

And the mountains crumble inside my head, the point of it all vanishes.
I look at everything happened to me and it seems like nothing but a heavy set of circumstances.

Seems we fail to 
Meet none the less. With
Hindsight I realize 
How prophetic
Were my words. 
All of this,
All of my advances
Were for nothing.

I sit down and
Feel nothing but weariness and
Apathy.

I just wish this day
Will end soon so I can be over and
Done with this.

She will never know of this misfortune.
