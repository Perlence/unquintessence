If we fail to meet then
All of this, all my
Advances, achievements
Will be all for nothing.

/x/x/x
/x/x/

Day has come. I've done all
I could, all I can remember
I've laid on the
Tiny piece of paper.

And suddenly everything goes wrong
Thunderstriking news above my comprehension
The gaping chasm between two choices
The second chance will divide us forever.

If we fail to meet then
All of this,
All of my advances
Were in vein.

So I choose not to 
Challenge myself any more.
I give up. And my 
Acts will be appreciated later.

I sacrifice my wealth and wellbeing to be near.

There is no way back.
I hit the road to home
Right now.
I am so excited 
I plant the seed of further
Failure.

And suddenly everything goes wrong again.
It appears that I forgot what I've been asked for.

And the mountains crumble inside my head, the point of it all vanishes in roaring laughter.
I look at everything happened to me and it seems like nothing but a heavy set of circumstances.

Now I can look back
And laugh or cry
I haven't decided yet.

It was all wrong.
The starting point of all this is wrong. 
Why did I do so?
