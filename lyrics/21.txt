Uh, A loss-flavoured colour of Mine
Sprayed on walls of empty homes
And moments of voices, giving a birth
To a soon broken vow (aw), in pieces

Most people on their toes are now
Just mark emphasis of empty kiss
From Abandoned bodies til' they climb
To the words that fail them

And each of roads I traveled
ended in broken hearts
Or abandoning Those In Need
So now I forget what I have returned
To these happy grins, and drool.
Above the sights, I suffer these wounds
Of flesh taken from me, though
I still salute to these proud
Perishing Vultures
Burning, when they fly away.

I can see You.
And Your wailing mourn
crawling from a grave
I curse You as You
were coming same roads
And still You are down to none.
