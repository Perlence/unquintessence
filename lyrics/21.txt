A loss-flavoured colour of Mine
Sprayed on walls of empty homes
And moments of voices, giving birth
To a soon broken vow, in pieces.

Most people on their toes are now
Mark emphasis of an empty kiss
From Abandoned bodies 'til they 
Climb to the words that fail them.

And each of roads I travelled
Ended in broken hearts
Or abandoning Those in Need. 

So now I forget what I have returned
To these happy grins, and drool.

Above the sights, I suffer these wounds

Of flesh taken from me, though
I still salute to these proud
Perishing Vultures
Burning when they fly away.

I Can
See You. 
And Your wailing mourn 
Crawling from a grave, 
I curse You as 
You were coming same roads
And still You are 
Down to none.
