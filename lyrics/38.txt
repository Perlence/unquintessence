When the fires die out to surrender,
Hero's name we'll not remember,
Last man standing will be me,
I am the worst part of your enemy.
 
I am always is and never was,
Will never let you come too close,
You got no kingdom, no control,
Obey or I'll take you with deathroll
 
Remember laughing just at me?
Tables turned, now you cry,
Your alter won't let you be,
Full of tears, now you're dry.
 
You are talking machines, hitting my chest,
But We are alive, so have a rest,
Fuck the people, fuck the wound,
Don't stare at me, I'm just gloomed.
 
Just try to ignore,
What, see nothing more?
Why? You're the same,
Is Creator to be put in blame?
 
Rigor mortis is your destination,
That's not MY violation,
Simple result of mind's temptation,
Poor self-keeping in brain reservation.
 
Don't make attempt to stop,
Couldn't I, couldn't you, It's egos (fucking) drop,
 
Do you want to have it all?
But why for me you ever call?
Live in cave, I'll stay in silver hall,
Remember what I said about deathroll?
 
Farewell, goodbye, so depressing,
Where are you, I am guessing,
Told you so clearly, I am fastening,
Now alone, put aside just on my own...
