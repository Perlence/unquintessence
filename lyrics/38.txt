Late fires die out to surrender
Deep in my cold embraces
So these gestures of acceptance
Won't be seen by worst part of me.

Each other home is void
I stare into to find
Myself picked clean 
And vestiges of what I had
And what will never be as beautiful
As it used to be.

Desperatedly throwing myself
In tunnels, I slumber slowly
through this reminiscence of brighter days
Which I skipped to gloom

This glare of unquintessence 
Was chasing me in every street
And flashdance.

I die out till singing "Love Lost. Impress"
And my victory is such
A lonely state
