Ego Anthem
==========

Late fires die out to 
Surrender deep in my cold embraces so these 
Gestures of 
Acceptance 
Won't be seen by worst 
Part of me.

Each other home is void 
I stare into to find myself picked clean 
And vestiges of what 
I had and what will never be 
As beautiful as it 
Used to be.

Desperatedly throwing myself in tunnels, 
I slumber slowly through this reminiscence 
Of brighter days which I skipped to gloom
Expecting severities to come.

This glare of 
Unquintessence 
Was chasing me in 
Every street and every flashdance.

I die out till singing 
"Love Lost. Impress".
And my victory is 
Such a lonely state.
