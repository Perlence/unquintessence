Empty rooms
And these empty benches
Make me miss
Times when they were full

With our friends
Ready to lend us a hand
When everything
Was against us.

What I've done, what I could
Will never get along, always juxtaposed.
Year thirteen is when we wave goodbye.

...

What I've done, what I could.
Let us draw a line. Time to count our losses.
Thirteen is when we leave.
