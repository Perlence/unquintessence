Empty rooms
And these empty benches
Make me miss
Times when they were full

With our friends
Ready to lend us a hand
When everything
Was against us.

What I've done, what I could
Will never get along, always juxtaposed.
Year thirteen is when we wave goodbye.

Tell me that
Life is just beginning.
But for now it seems like
It's about to end.

Our paths are 
Clouded in uncertainty.
Through this fog
I can't see myself.

What I've done, what I could.
Let us draw a line. Time to count our losses.
Thirteen is when we leave.

My dear ones,
Will we ever meet again.
It's alright.
Let's enjoy this final day.
