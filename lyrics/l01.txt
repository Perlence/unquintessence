I walked downhill
  In hasty slow-motion
Manoeuvring through
  Impervious melting snow.

Concerned with thoughts
  I looked beneath my feet and
Was stunned with sight
  Of rainbow in the brook.

It was so clear.
  The rich and vibrant color
Flowed down the stream
  To vanish in the sea.
