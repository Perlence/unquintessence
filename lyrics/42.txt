Pits
====

As the arrows fly we fall in the 
Bottomless pit. Leaving no 
Place for proud,
Benevolent gentlemen.

Loving soldier loses his 
Affection in harmless explosions
His foot is a cake. 
Your smile is all that he had.

We will never truly escape.

Animate with dysfunctions
See my hands spin out of control.
My mind cannot perceive
All your facial expressions.

Through the scope I see us being 
Ran over by train.
With squeaking sound you grab me 
To die senselessly.
