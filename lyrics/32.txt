The only thing I hear is 
That we are heading for the decay
Rotting slowly away.

They say it ain't much left to
Destroy. The city is in ruins
Already and it's not their fault.

But they know who to blame
And they do.

Will I turn to be like them in time,
Hating everything and everyone,
Having no more hope in future
As they do.

Will never turn and smile to the
Stranger on my way because they're all monsters,
Speeding up my pace to reach shelter.

Someone does his best to keep 
Me feel not secure and his method
Actually works for most.

But they don't seem to blame
Him for this.

I close the door.
I hold my ears.

Spare me now from the pain of all world
This bring me sadness and indifference.
I have no concern in things I don't control.
It helps me everyday.

Crawl through the truth
So contrived and sinister.
You're seeing yellow.
Your color is yellow.
You vultures!

Shower me in pure joy I'm so
So tired of seeing it as postponed drama,
I want to absorb it all
And never let it stale inside.

Filler of airtime,
Eater of life
Feed me with rotten,
Nurture the pests.

I want you burn.
