Golden Bridges
==============

I grasp through shattered window
A higher burden. 
A longing bridge was 
Golden.

I kept my bluesings 
And howlings to the moon
While all they were 
Selling my love

On the marketplaces and 
Folding every hand
To come by 
These golden bridges.

I couldn't be of something less and 
Lower than any bitter way.
Do you find relief in being
Passed from palm to palm?

Raised as fool among dividing hearts
And sinking ships, could any of you
Take me down with these wretched starts
No one will ever look into?

I sing allong with 
Everything what fades so 
Our voices 
Are in tune. 

While floodwaters will rise.

And noise of muddy water is
Sign of my arrival 
To your estates.

But I touch your broken 
String and still my mandolin
Does not sing. I bowed all 
The tyrants crowned.

But was left unguided. Do I have a 
Place to wander& These doves in the
Sky are a flea in open cage.
Seems I stop the storyline.

Only those on solemn 
Grounds would feel a sadness 
From choice to care while I keep 
Looking at the golden bridges.
