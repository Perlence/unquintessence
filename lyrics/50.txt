Golden Bridges


I grasp through shattered window
A higher burden. A longing bridge was golden
I kept my bluesings and howlings to the moon
While all they were selling my love
On the marketplaces and folding every hand
To come by these golden bridges.

I couldn't be of something less
And lower than the any bitter way
Do you find relief in being
Passed from palm to palm?

Raised as fool among dividing hearts
And sinking ships, could any of you
Take me down with these wretched starts
No one will ever look into?

I sing along with everything what fades
so our voices are in tune
While floodwaters will rise
And noise of muddy water is
sign of my arrival to your estates.

Only those on solemn grounds
would feel a sadness from choice to care
While i keep looking
At the golden bridges.
